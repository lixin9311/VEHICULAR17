\section{Introduction}

Road transportation is an essential part of human daily life.
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is designed to improve the road traffic by achieving safe,
efficient and autonomous transportation.
Cooperative ITS and vehicular communication are found essential to the
cooperation of on-road vehicles and other forms of transport and pedestrians,
whereby sensor information is shared between road users to,
in effect, extend a driverâ€™s field of vision.
Cooperative ITS can not only be used to provide driver assistance with the not so distant future
but also to feed more data to full autonomous driving.

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee 204 (ISO / TC 204)
is responsible for the overall system aspects and infrastructure aspects of intelligent transport systems (ITS).
And Working Group 18 (ISO/TC 204/WG 18) of it is responsible for Cooperative systems.
Also in Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has standardized wireless communication and applications of ITS.
In the US, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has standardized Wireless Access
in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) architecture in IEEE 1609 family of standards and IEEE802.11p.

ETSI has standardized a Cooperative Awareness Basic Service to inform each road user about other's position, dynamics, and attributes.
The awareness of each other is the basis for several road safety and traffic efficiency applications.
It is achieved by regular exchange of information among vehicles and between vehicles (V2V)
and road side infrastructure (V2I and I2V) based on wireless networks.
Other CITS architectures besides ETSI standard have similar designs to provide such function.
The information to be exchanged for cooperative awareness is picked up in the periodically transmitted Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM).
This service is a mandatory facility for all kind of ITS-Stations (ITS-S).
The dissemination of CAMs may vary depending on the applied communication system.
But in most cases, CAMs are sent by the originating ITS-S to all ITS-Ss within the direct communication range.
