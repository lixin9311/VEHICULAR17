\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have shown what issues are left unsolved with our previous design.
Then we have presented a preliminary design of Extended Proxy CAM,
to provide an infrastructure-free assisted V2V message system.
Such design is aimed to generate CAMs for those non-ITS enabled road users,
and meanwhile relay the CAMs when the CAMs could suffer interference.

We haven't implemented such system yet. For the future work, we are going to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement an experimental system to do field test, to see how much such system can improve.
\item Discuss the security of such system, to improve its compatibility and make it proof to attacks.
\item Integrate it with existed ITS framworks or stacks, and make it a standard.
\end{enumerate}
