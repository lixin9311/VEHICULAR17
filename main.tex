Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems
(CITS) are being developed to make road traffic safer and more efficient.
Vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication plays an important role for the cooperative
awareness of vehicles in all the CITS standards in EU, US, and Japan.
Essentially the CITS application relies on the exchanged data by V2V messages (called Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) in EU).
In our previous work, we have presented an infrastructure-based system to overcome the 2 significant problems:
1) mixed environment and 2) obstacle interference.
But the previous design still relies on infrastructure, hence it is still constrained by the environment.
Moreover, large vehicles on road could be obstacles for sensors and even wireless communications.
To solve these problems, we propose the system called Extended Proxy CAM.
It could be installed on large vehicles and infrastructure to generate or relay the necessary V2V messages.
We design the system based on standardized ITS architecture in ISO/ETSI, and it could be easily adapted to other ITS architectures.
